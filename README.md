### Problem Statement:
Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or
person in order to get sensitive information such as login credentials or account
information via email or other communication channels. Phishing is popular among
attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears
to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures.
The mail goal is to predict whether the domains are real or malicious.
